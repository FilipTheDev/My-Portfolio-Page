# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site built with React and TypeScript. I created it to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in web development.

## Tech Stack

- React 
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion for animations

## Features

I've included sections for my projects, skills, work history, and a contact form. The site is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices too.

The UI is clean and focused on showcasing my work with a bit of personality. I've used Framer Motion for some subtle animations that make the site feel more dynamic without being distracting.

## Development

If you want to run this locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

All my personal info is stored in `/src/data/portfolioData.ts` which makes it easy to update when needed.

## Customization

All portfolio content can be customized through the data file in `/src/data/portfolioData.ts`:

- Personal information (name, contact details, social media links)
- Hero section content
- About section with bio and personal details
- Projects with images, descriptions, and links
